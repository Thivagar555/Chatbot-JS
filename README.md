## What I Learned

This project helped me learn how to handle user input in a web application and respond dynamically using JavaScript.  
I explored how simple decision-making can simulate basic AI behavior using conditionals and keyword matching.  
It gave me confidence in working with DOM elements and building fully frontend-based interactive projects.
