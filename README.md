# Simple-ChatBot-Pure-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript
## Built With: HTML | CSS | JavaScript (No libraries/frameworks)

## Project Overview

This project is a lightweight, interactive chatbot interface created entirely with pure front-end technologies. It simulates a basic chat experience where users can type in a message, and the bot responds with predefined answers. Though simple in functionality, the project emphasizes real-time interactivity and a modern, attractive design.

This chatbot can serve as:

* A beginner-friendly JavaScript project

* A template for real chatbot integrations (e.g., Dialogflow, OpenAI, etc.)

* A frontend UI for support assistants or onboarding flows
